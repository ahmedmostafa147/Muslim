  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/Images/
    - assets/database/
    - assets/fonts/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Cairo
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Cairo-Medium.ttf

    - family: Quran
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Quran.ttf
    - family: Quran2
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Quran2.ttf

    - family: ArefRuqaa
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/ArefRuqaa-Regular.ttf
        
    - family: NotoNastaliqUrdu
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoNastaliqUrdu-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/NotoNastaliqUrdu-Regular.ttf
